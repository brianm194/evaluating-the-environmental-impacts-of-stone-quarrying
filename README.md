# Quarry Impact Assessment Using GIS, Remote Sensing, and Deep Learning

## Overview
This project investigates the environmental and socio-economic impacts of small-scale building stone quarrying activities in Central Imenti, Meru County, Kenya. Using multi-temporal satellite imagery, GIS spatial analysis, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the study characterizes historical changes (2000â€“2023) and predicts potential quarrying impacts for the year 2030.

## Objectives
- **Spatial Analysis:** Map and quantify the spatial extent and temporal changes of quarrying activities from 2000 to 2023.
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the associated environmental and socio-economic impacts using deep learning (CNN).
- **Predictive Modeling:** Forecast future impacts of quarrying activities for the year 2030.

## Data Sources
- **Satellite Imagery:** Landsat 7, 8, and 9; Sentinel-2 datasets.
- **Ancillary Data:** Population datasets, soil datasets, and land use/land cover (LULC) maps.

## Tools and Technologies
- **GIS Software:** ArcGIS Pro, QGIS
- **Remote Sensing Platform:** Google Earth Engine (GEE)
- **Programming Environment:** Google Colab (Python)
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**  
   - Downloaded and preprocessed satellite imagery from 2000 to 2023.
   - Corrected atmospheric and radiometric distortions.
2. **Classification and Mapping:**  
   - Conducted supervised classification for LULC mapping.
   - Extracted quarry locations and quantified area changes.
3. **Impact Assessment Using CNN:**  
   - Built and trained a CNN model to analyze quarry-induced land changes.
   - Validated model performance with ground-truth data.
4. **Prediction of Future Impacts:**  
   - Modeled and visualized potential quarrying impacts for 2030.
